# Latency R&D Notes

This log tracks evidence from the May 28, 2026 production-latency push. It is
not a benchmark contract; use the JSON reports under `out/` and production smoke
commands as the authoritative artifacts.

## Ground Truth Caveat

Houston Waymo, Miami Waymo, Bay Area Waymo, and Las Vegas Zoox are tracked as
`reference_mismatch` in `benchmarks/service-area-fixtures.json`. They remain
visible in reports but are not scored as model regressions until the reference
polygons and screenshots are refreshed.

## Shipped Changes

- `5c69590`: cache-only exploratory geocoder fanout, decisive OSM-place fast
  path, and seeded Phoenix/Nashville road points. Cold local Tesla cases moved
  to roughly half-second CLI runs; active full benchmark stayed green.
- `b8878ff`: removed `pyproj` by using the existing Web Mercator formulas.
  Vercel's bundle warning dropped from 361.06 MB to 329.50 MB.
- `63dbb1b`: included the pipeline hash in server run-cache keys so cached
  results cannot survive incompatible pipeline changes.
- `5f28d22`: increased road-refinement vectorized scoring batch size from 64
  to 256. Controlled local probes preserved Phoenix/Nashville road scores while
  reducing road-refinement-heavy CLI runs.
- Conservative RapidOCR input downscaling caps the OCR image's longest side at
  2000px by default, with coordinates scaled back to the original image. This
  keeps an env override through `MAP_BOUNDARY_RAPIDOCR_MAX_DIMENSION`.
- Road refinement now samples up to 6000 road points by default instead of
  12000, preserving the full active suite while reducing Phoenix/Nashville
  focused benchmark time.
- The Vercel API path now caps generated overlay previews at 1200px before
  encoding the inline artifact, while CLI/debug outputs keep full-size overlays.
  GeoJSON/extraction/georeferencing stay unchanged.

- Focused no-downscale A/B (`Orlando`, `Phoenix`, `Nashville`, `San Antonio`):
  old path PASS 4/4 in 10.24s, avg IoU 0.946, min IoU 0.896.
- Focused default-2000 A/B on the same four fixtures: PASS 4/4 in 8.84s,
  avg IoU 0.958, min IoU 0.931.
- Focused Phoenix/Nashville with batch size 256: PASS 2/2, IoUs 0.978 and
  0.981, matching the high-accuracy baseline.
- Focused Phoenix/Nashville road-point cap sweep: 12000 points PASS 2/2 in
  6.52s, 6000 points PASS 2/2 in 5.04s with Phoenix IoU 0.983 and Nashville
  IoU 0.981.
- Warm local preview generation A/B after caches are populated: Orlando export
  stage dropped from 0.150s/full-size overlay to 0.047s/1200px overlay; Phoenix
  export dropped from 0.153s to 0.055s. Inline overlay encoding dropped from
  0.133s to 0.056s on Orlando and 0.107s to 0.060s on Phoenix.

## Production Smoke Evidence

- Deployment `dpl_D4bY7N2MhTcHqQAGKWmVAjM5R5X2` is live on
  `https://mapboundary.app`.
- Health after deploy: `pipeline-47330c90d8ab7fd6`, runtime `vercel-python`,
  `tesseract: null`.
- Production unique-image smoke after bounded previews:
  - Orlando Waymo: HTTP 201, 13.55s wall, 9.69s event span, confidence 0.909,
    6 controls, export 0.250s, returned overlay `image/webp` at 1200x1200.
  - Phoenix Waymo: HTTP 201, 16.13s wall, 13.35s event span, confidence 0.917,
    6 controls, road score 0.69856, export 0.254s, returned overlay
    `image/webp` at 1200x1200.

## Failed Or Rejected Experiments

- Narrowing the road-refinement grid improved speed but reduced Nashville IoU
  from 0.981 to 0.885. Rejected as an accuracy regression.
- A moderate grid reduction still lowered Nashville IoU to 0.942. Rejected
  because the goal requires no accuracy reduction, not merely passing thresholds.
- RapidOCR max dimension 2200 was faster locally but dropped Orlando IoU from
  0.930 to 0.863 in focused validation. Rejected.
- Road-point cap 3000 was faster but dropped Nashville IoU to 0.796. Rejected.
- RapidOCR without the angle classifier matched normal focused fixtures but
  produced high-count gibberish on a 180-degree rotated Orlando stress image,
  while classifier-enabled OCR recovered readable labels. Rejected for
  robustness.
- Extraction downscaling sped up direct mask extraction, but even a 2000px cap
  moved Phoenix IoU from 0.983 to 0.982 and lower caps shifted additional
  stable fixtures. Rejected under the no-regression accuracy bar.
- Local `vercel build --prod` remained blocked unless `uv` is on PATH; remote
  deploys are the reliable bundle-size evidence source for now.

## Remaining Bottlenecks

- Production still exceeds Vercel's Python bundle threshold at about 310.69 MB,
  so runtime dependency installation and cold starts remain the biggest
  production-only latency problem.
- The largest dependency weights are OpenCV and ONNX Runtime. Removing either
  would require a larger architecture change and must be proven against the full
  active fixture suite before production.
